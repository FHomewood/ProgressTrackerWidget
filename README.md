## Aims
This software is produced by me, an individual developer, for the purposes of self improvement. Below is a list of aims that I hope this project will help me achieve:

* This is my first project using Java and XML I am hoping this project will teach me a lot about the structure and use of these languages such that I can continue developing in them
* Improve my understanding about how App Developement works, this is also my first project using Android Studio.
* Successful implementation of a small SQL database, of which I have not attempted for ~4 years.

This is a rather ambitious project for me, challenging me in multiple areas, so commiting to this project will increase my programming competence significantly.
